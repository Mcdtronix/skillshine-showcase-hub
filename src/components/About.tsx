                Hello! I'm John, a passionate software developer with a deep interest in creating digital 
                experiences that live at the intersection of technology and design.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My journey in software development began during my university years when I built my first 
                web application. Since then, I've had the privilege of working across various domains of 
                computer science, from web and mobile development to machine learning and cloud architecture.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies. My goal is 
                to create software that not only meets technical requirements but also delivers an exceptional 
                user experience.
              </p>

              <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
              
              <ul className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mt-4">
                {["JavaScript (ES6+)", "TypeScript", "React", "Node.js", "Python", "Django", "TensorFlow", "AWS"].map((tech, index) => (
                  <li key={index} className="flex items-center">
                    <span className="text-teal mr-2">‚ñπ</span>
                    <span>{tech}</span>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div className="relative group">
